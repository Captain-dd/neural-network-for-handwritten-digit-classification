# neural-network-for-handwritten-digit-classification

In this python project we have designed different dense neuratel network for handwritten digit classification. 
We have created a simple dense neural network with input layer and output layer.
We have also created another dense neural network with input layer, 2 hidden layer and output layer to achive higher accuracy.
For this project we have used mnist dataset provided by keras dataset api.
